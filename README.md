#  dronize-exploit

Drone Identification Signal And Retargeting Mimicker (DISARM) is a small software package for interacting with SiK radios to disarm rouge drones. 

## About 
dronize-exploit is based on the concept of mimicking ID codes in the Mavlink communication protocol to take arbitrary control on nearby drone. 

## Requirements
To use this software package you will need to purchase a [SiK Radio](https://docs.px4.io/en/telemetry/sik_radio.html), which can be purchased at multiple locations online.
On the software side you will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/) and a `Unix` based system like `MacOs` or `Linux`. Though this project is dockerized, it requires access to the `/dev/` directory so dronize-exploit can automatically interact with your SiK radio. 

## Installation
Once you have `Docker` downloaded, you may need to use `sudo`, use this command to pull the image:
```bash
docker pull moayyad57/dronize-exploit 
```

## Usage
Run this to launch the dronize-exploit system:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v /dev/:/dev/ moayyad57/dronize-exploit 
```
Now plug the SiK radio into any available usb port.
Finnaly run this to start disarming any system in the area:
```bash
./start_disarming
```
